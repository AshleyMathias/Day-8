# Day-8
Caesar Cipher Project
Project Description
This program implements a simple Caesar Cipher to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting letters of the alphabet. The user can choose between encoding or decoding messages with a specified shift amount.

Features
Text Encryption & Decryption: Encode and decode messages by shifting letters.
Input Flexibility: Handles non-alphabetical characters (numbers, spaces, special symbols) by leaving them unchanged.
User-Friendly: Provides prompts and options to continue or exit after each operation.
Code Breakdown
Alphabet List: Contains the letters of the English alphabet for shifting operations.

caesar() Function: Handles both encoding and decoding by shifting letters based on user input.

Loop for Continuation: Allows users to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.

How to Run
Clone this repository or copy the script into your local environment.
Ensure you have art.py available to display the logo at program start.
Run the program and follow the prompts to encode or decode messages.
